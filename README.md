# hello-world

Hi, my name is Jos√© Luis, I'm writing from Huelva, a city in southwestern Spain, specifically in Andalusia.

Since I was little, I've been fascinated by computers. When I was a kid, I was taught how to use Excel and Access, and I used to play at creating fictional databases and spreadsheets.

Later, when I started using the Internet, I began to create my first websites. First with FrontPage (what a horror!), then with Dreamweaver, and later I got to know some CMSs like Joomla or WordPress, which introduced me to the world of HTML, CSS, and a little bit of PHP.

On my own, I've learned a bit of Python and C++.

For a while now, I've been learning on my own about web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) while also researching game development (right now I'm thinking about learning how to use Godot, as it's an open source tool).

Apart from all that, I've become quite interested in using the terminal in Linux.

In short, I have a lot on my plate, and in my profile you'll probably find repositories of quite varied topics.

Time to start the journey of "Version Control" and "Commits". I'm looking forward to it!

Greetings from this corner of the planet that if you haven't visited yet, you should be planning to do so already! ;)
